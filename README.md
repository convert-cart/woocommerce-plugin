## Introduction

Welcome to the WooCommerce Plugin by Convert Cart. Our plugin extends WooCommerce functionality by integrating additional webhooks and filters into the official REST API, enhancing capabilities beyond the default setup. Additionally, it seamlessly injects scripts into the frontend to track user behavior, empowering our recommendation engine. This engine utilizes data-driven insights to deliver personalized enhancements to your ecommerce operations.

## Features

This plugin provides a range of features to integrate your WooCommerce store with Convert Cart's analytics and optimization services:

*   **Frontend User Behavior Tracking:**
    *   Injects tracking scripts (`window.ccLayer`) automatically into your store's frontend.
    *   Tracks key WooCommerce events and page views:
        *   `productViewed`: Captures views of individual product pages, including product ID, name, price, URL, and image.
        *   `categoryViewed`: Tracks views of product category pages, including category ID, name, and URL.
        *   `cartViewed`: Records when a user views their shopping cart, including details of the items in the cart.
        *   `checkoutStarted`: Fires when a user begins the checkout process, capturing cart contents.
        *   `orderCompleted`: Tracks successful order placements on the thank you page, sending comprehensive order details (ID, total, currency, status, coupon codes used, and line item details like name, price, quantity, URL, image).
        *   `contentViewed`: Tracks views of general WordPress pages and the homepage, capturing page title and URL.
*   **Consent Management (Email & SMS):**
    *   Provides distinct settings to enable and manage customer consent collection for both Email and SMS marketing.
    *   Consent modes: `Live` (collects consent from all users), `Draft` (shows checkboxes only for admins), `Disabled`.
    *   Automatically adds consent checkboxes to relevant WooCommerce locations:
        *   Checkout page (before the place order button).
        *   User Registration form (on the My Account page).
        *   My Account details page (allowing users to manage their consent).
    *   Offers dedicated admin pages (`WooCommerce > CC SMS Consent`, `WooCommerce > CC Email Consent`) to customize the HTML content of the consent checkboxes using a CodeMirror editor.
    *   Persists consent choices:
        *   Saves consent status ('yes'/'no') to WooCommerce order meta data for every order.
        *   Saves consent status to WordPress user meta data for registered users.
    *   Handles consent capture correctly even when a user creates an account during the checkout process.
    *   **SMS Specific:** Includes logic to check previous guest orders (by email) when a user registers, potentially updating their SMS consent status based on prior interactions.
*   **Backend Integration & Configuration:**
    *   Adds an integration settings page under `WooCommerce > Settings > Integration > CC Analytics Settings`.
    *   Requires a unique `Client ID / Domain Id` provided by Convert Cart to activate tracking.
    *   Includes an optional `Debug Mode` setting to send additional technical metadata (WP version, WC version, PHP version etc.) for troubleshooting.
    *   Provides internal functions to retrieve customer data and consent status based on user ID or email address.
    *   Supports data synchronization mechanisms (e.g., via webhooks, API - inferred) for products, orders, customers, etc., to power Convert Cart services.
*   **Developer & Maintenance:**
    *   Uses standard WordPress and WooCommerce hooks and filters for compatibility.
    *   Employs WooCommerce CRUD methods and functions for HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage) compatibility.
    *   Utilizes the WooCommerce Logger for standardized error logging.
    *   Includes development tooling setup (`composer.json`) for code linting using PHP Code Sniffer and WordPress Coding Standards.
