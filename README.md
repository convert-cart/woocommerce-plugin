## Introduction

Welcome to the WooCommerce Plugin by Convert Cart. Our plugin extends WooCommerce functionality by integrating additional webhooks and filters into the official REST API, enhancing capabilities beyond the default setup.

This engine utilizes data-driven insights to deliver personalized enhancements to your ecommerce operations.

## Features

- Script injection on the frontend for user behavior tracking.
- Token generation for synchronizing product/order/customer/category data to Convert Cart servers for recommendations.
- Adding webhooks through the official REST API and plugin code.
